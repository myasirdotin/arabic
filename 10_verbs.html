    <h1>📌 Arabic Verbs (الأفعال)</h1>
    <p class="subtitle"><strong>الماضي، المضارع، الأمر</strong> — Past, Present, Command</p>

    <div class="note intro-note">
      <p>Arabic verbs are fascinating! They are built on "root systems" (usually 3 letters) and change form significantly based on "tense, person, gender, and number". Understanding them is key to mastering Arabic.</p>

    <h2>✅ The Three Main Tenses:</h2>
    <p>Arabic primarily distinguishes between three tenses, which are crucial for forming sentences.</p>
    <div class="table-responsive">

          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
    </div>

    <h2>🎯 Root System (الجذر): The Building Blocks</h2>
    <div class="root-box info-box">
      <p>Most Arabic verbs and many nouns derive from a "3-letter root" (الجذر). This root carries the core meaning.</p>
      <div class="arabic-large root-display">ك - ت - ب</div>
      <p>From this powerful root, meaning "to write," we derive a whole family of related words:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><span class="arabic">كَتَبَ</span> (kataba) - He wrote (verb)</li>
        <li><span class="arabic">كِتابٌ</span> (kitāb) - Book (noun)</li>
        <li><span class="arabic">مَكْتَبَةٌ</span> (maktabah) - Library / Bookstore (noun of place)</li>
        <li><span class="arabic">كَاتِبٌ</span> (kātib) - Writer (active participle / noun of doer)</li>
        <li><span class="arabic">مَكْتُوبٌ</span> (maktūb) - Written / Letter (passive participle / noun of object)</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="note-small"><strong>Pronunciation Tip:</strong> The diacritics (harakat) are vital for correct pronunciation and meaning. We've added transliterations for some examples to help.</p>
    </div>

    ---

    <h2>📘 Past Tense (الماضي) Conjugation:</h2>
    <p>The past tense is formed by "suffixes" added to the root. The base form is often the "he" form.</p>

    <div class="tip-box warning">
      <h3>⚠️ Important Notes & Key Takeaways:</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>The "present tense" (المضارع) in Arabic often implies a "continuous" action ("is writing") or a habitual action ("writes").</li>
        <li>"Command forms" (الأمر) change significantly based on the "gender and number" of the person being addressed.</li>
        <li>Verbs must always "agree with their subjects" in "gender and number". Pay close attention to this!</li>
        <li>"Negation" in Arabic uses special particles:
          <ul>
            <li><span class="arabic">لَمْ</span> (lam) for negating the "past tense" (precedes a jussive present verb, e.g., <span class="arabic">لَمْ يَكْتُبْ</span> "he did not write").</li>
            <li><span class="arabic">لا</span> (lā) for negating the "present tense" or for general negation (e.g., <span class="arabic">لا يَكْتُبُ</span> "he does not write").</li>
            <li><span class="arabic">مَا</span> (mā) can also negate the "past tense" directly (e.g., <span class="arabic">مَا كَتَبَ</span> "he did not write").</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>The "future tense" is formed by simply adding the prefix <span class="arabic">سَـ</span> (sa-) or the particle <span class="arabic">سَوْفَ</span> (sawfa) before the "present tense" verb (e.g., <span class="arabic">سَيَكْتُبُ</span> or <span class="arabic">سَوْفَ يَكْتُبُ</span> "he will write").</li>
        <li>Keep an eye on the "diacritics (harakat)", as they are crucial for correct pronunciation and distinguishing between similar-looking words.</li>
      </ol>
